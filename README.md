What was the day of the week on 28th May, 2006?
a)Thursday
b)Friday
c)Saturday
d)Sunday
Answer: Option d

Explanation:
28 May, 2006 = (2005 years + Period from 1.1.2006 to 28.5.2006)

Odd days in 1600 years = 0

Odd days in 400 years = 0

5 years = (4 ordinary years + 1 leap year) = (4 x 1 + 1 x 2)  6 odd days

Jan. Feb. March April May (31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 28 ) = 148 days
 148 days = (21 weeks + 1 day)  1 odd day.

Total number of odd days = (0 + 0 + 6 + 1) = 7  0 odd day.

Given day is Sunday.
